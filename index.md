I am interested in the cognitive and neural bases of human memory. My research combines behavioural and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that support retrieval of past experiences and expression of knowledge.

I received my PhD from the University of Cambridge where I studied the organisation of semantic memory. I then joined Duke University as a postdoc to investigate the neural correlates of episodic memory. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at Faculdade de Psicologia, Universidade de Lisboa.

Memory is expressed in a dynamic manner. It is not a passive storehouse, it is the result of interactions between cues, goals and knowledge. My research focuses on understanding the cognitive and neural dynamics of episodic and semantic memory. What neural aspects are common and distinct when retrieving specific past experiences vs. general knowledge about the world? How does semantic information improve or hinder recollection of past events? How does the prefrontal cortex interact with temporal-parietal regions to mediate memory and knowledge? I use cognitive and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods to investigate how different brain regions cooperate to support memory retrieval and expression of knowledge.

I received my PhD from the University of Cambridge where I studied the organisation of semantic memory under the supervision of Lorraine Tyler and Helen Moss. I then joined Ian Dobbins and Scott Huettel Labs at Duke University to investigate the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval. Currently, I am a researcher at the Center for Psychological Research at the University of Lisbon. My research is funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology (C2008-UL-CP-2 and PTDC/PSI-PCO/113774/2009).

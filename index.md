I am interested in the cognitive and neural bases of human memory. My research combines behavioural and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that support retrieval of past experiences and expression of knowledge.

I received my PhD from the [University of Cambridge](https://cslb.psychol.cam.ac.uk) where I studied the organisation of semantic memory. I then joined [Duke University](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu) as a postdoc to investigate the neural correlates of episodic memory. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at [Faculdade de Psicologia](http://www.psicologia.ulisboa.pt) and member of the [Research Center for Psychological Science](http://www.psicologia.ulisboa.pt/cicpsi/) of Universidade de Lisboa. My research is funded by [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/index.phtml.en) and [Bial](https://www.bial.com/en/).
